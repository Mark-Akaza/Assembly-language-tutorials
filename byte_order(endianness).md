### **Little Endian vs. Big Endian Memory Storage**  

**1. Little Endian (Used by x86 Processors)**  
- The **least significant byte (LSB)** is stored at the **lowest** memory address.  
- Example: **`12345678h` (doubleword) stored at offset `0000`**  

| Memory Address | Stored Value |
|---------------|-------------|
| `0000`        | `78h`       |
| `0001`        | `56h`       |
| `0002`        | `34h`       |
| `0003`        | `12h`       |

âœ… **Byte order in memory: `78 56 34 12`**

**2. Big Endian (Used by Some Other Architectures)**  
- The **most significant byte (MSB)** is stored at the **lowest** memory address.  
- Example: **`12345678h` stored at offset `0000`**  

| Memory Address | Stored Value |
|---------------|-------------|
| `0000`        | `12h`       |
| `0001`        | `34h`       |
| `0002`        | `56h`       |
| `0003`        | `78h`       |

âœ… **Byte order in memory: `12 34 56 78`**

### **Key Differences**  
| **Feature**       | **Little Endian (x86, Intel, AMD)** | **Big Endian (Motorola, PowerPC, SPARC)** |
|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Byte Order      | LSB at lowest address           | MSB at lowest address          |
| Example Order  (`12345678h`) | `78 56 34 12` | `12 34 56 78` |
| Used By         | x86, ARM (default mode), Intel, AMD | Older mainframes, networking protocols |

### **Why Does This Matter?**
1. **Data Interpretation:** When sharing data between systems (e.g., network packets), endian format must be considered.  
2. **Low-Level Programming:** When accessing memory directly, knowing endian format is crucial.  
3. **Binary File Handling:** Some file formats use a specific endian order (e.g., BMP uses Little Endian).
