1Ô∏è‚É£ Integer Constants
Whole numbers used in programs.

Can be represented in:

Decimal (e.g., 25)

Hexadecimal (e.g., 0x1A, 1Ah)

Binary (e.g., 1010b)

Octal (e.g., 037o)



2Ô∏è‚É£ Integer Expressions
Combine integer constants using operators:

+, -, *, /, MOD, AND, OR

Example:

assembly
Copy
Edit
MOV AX, 5 + 3



3Ô∏è‚É£ Real Number Constants
Represent fractional numbers (floating-point).

Example:

Copy
Edit
3.14, -0.5


4Ô∏è‚É£ Character Constants
Single character enclosed in single quotes.

Example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
'A', 'b'
Stored as ASCII values.


5Ô∏è‚É£ String Constants
Sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

Example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"Hello", "World!"


6Ô∏è‚É£ Reserved Words
Words predefined by the assembler.

Examples:

Instructions: MOV, ADD, SUB

Directives: DB, DW, END

Registers: AX, BX, SI

Operators: AND, OR, NOT

Cannot be used as variable names.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Identifiers
Names for variables, labels, or constants.

Rules:

Start with a letter.

Can include letters, numbers, and underscores (_).

Must not be a reserved word.

Example:

Copy
Edit
count, total_sum, loop1



8Ô∏è‚É£ Directives
Commands for the assembler, not for CPU execution.

Control how the program is structured.

Examples:

DB (Define Byte)

DW (Define Word)

SEGMENT, ENDS, END




9Ô∏è‚É£ Instructions
Actual commands executed by CPU.

Categories:

Data Transfer: MOV, XCHG

Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MUL

Logical: AND, OR, XOR

Control Flow: JMP, CALL




üîü NOP (No Operation) Instruction
NOP = No Operation

Does nothing, consumes 1 CPU cycle.

Used for:

Timing adjustments

Instruction alignment

Debugging / Patching
